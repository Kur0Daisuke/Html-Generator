# Html-Generator
it will generate files those are necessary for building a website.
`Create what?`
> well, i can just right click and make my own self :|

Actually this project/extension? Is used only for people who is "lazy" enough to make their own, this won't generate much stuff but if i have more motivation i would add more interesting features ;)

Feel free to `download` and try but go to the [official python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install its necessary files before testing if you havn't.
